## Written Instructions
First install the plugin here:
https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/751892393146479981/Roller-%C2%B7-Design-Linter-%C2%B7-Toybox

Effective way to get your designs consistent before handing-off to your team. Open Roller on any of your Figma Files and Pages to reach 100% consistency. Every time you reopen the plugin, Roller will automatically check for any rogue styles and help you get back on-system.

#### Steps moving forward
##### 1. Add your style

##### 2. Fix errors

##### 3. Reach 100% consistency

## 1. Add your styles
##### Manually add your styles
You can add your colors, text styles, borders, and radius styles manually with a preview interface and live preview. All you have to do is enter in your values, name it, and press save.

##### Import your locally saved styles
If you already have styles Roller can automatically detect them. You can make changes to imported styles at any time.

## 2. Fix errors
Once your styles have been added Roller will automatically "lint" your current Figma Page. It will compare the styles in your Library to the styles present on the page. If there are styles that don't match, Roller will display the errors.

##### Viewing errors
Roller will provide an overview of what styles do or don't have errors when you open the plugin.

##### Replacing errors
When you click into an error, Roller will automatically bring you to the first layer that it’s affecting — contextually showing you what’s wrong. From there, you can select what style from your Library you’d like to replace the error with. You can choose to replace the error affecting only that layer or replace all the errors at once.

##### Ignoring errors
If you have a style that isn't in your library and you want to ignore it you and click on the icon with three dots and Ignore that specific error, Ignore all of the same exact error, or Add to the Style Guide. Adding it directly from the view. Pretty cool, huh? Thanks Toybox!
